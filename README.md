# Cryptonite
Standard cryptographic algorithms in a Swift Playground
# CryptoJS
Cryptonite leverages the [CryptoJS](https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/) repository via JavaScriptCore framework. It is featured in a playground here but can transfered to a regular app as well.
# Example
As you'll see in the playground all is self-explanatory and easy to use, simply write:
```
Cryptonite.sha1(str)
Cryptonite.sha224(str)
Cryptonite.sha256(str)
Cryptonite.sha384(str)
Cryptonite.sha512(str)
Cryptonite.sha3(str)
Cryptonite.md5(str)
Cryptonite.ripemd160(str)
```
